  "text": "A 15-day-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because of one day of fussiness and not nursing well and a rectal temperature of 38.4 °C (101.1 °F). The patient was born at 38 weeks' gestation without complications. The pregnancy was unremarkable. Maternal prenatal labs (including group B streptococcus carriage) were negative. There have been no known sick exposures. Until this illness, the patient has been breastfeeding well with appropriate weight gain. Parents deny upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 44/min, blood pressure is 74/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears alert and fussy in parent's arms. The anterior fontanelle is open and flat. There is <2 second capillary refill and 2+ peripheral pulses. The patient is tachypneic without increased work of breathing. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are within normal limits. There is no rash. Lab work is obtained and includes complete blood count (CBC), inflammatory markers, blood culture, urinalysis, urine culture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies and culture, and respiratory viral panel (RVP). Results are pending. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

  "explanation": "**Major takeaway:**\n**Infants less than 21 days old who develop a fever require hospitalization and empiric treatment with intravenous antibacterials (and antivirals) until a source is identified.**\n\n**Main explanation:**\nThis previously healthy **15-day-old girl** presents to the emergency department with **fever and fussiness for <24 hours**. Given this patient's **age**, the recommendation is to **admit her for empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics** while awaiting laboratory testing results. **Empiric treatment for a patient this age includes intravenous Ampicillin and Ceftazidime (+/- Acyclovir if the infant is at risk for or shows signs of herpes simplex virus).**\n\n**Patients 60 days or younger with a fever are at a higher risk of invasive bacterial infections than older infants.** The initial step in management is **Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure (ABCDE)** assessment to ensure the patient is stable. Patients with a fever at this age require **IV access with vital sign monitoring**. They may also require **supplemental oxygen and vasopressors**.\n\nThe fever can be treated with **acetaminophen**. Additional treatment and disposition depend on the patient's specific age and on an identified source. **Patients 0–21 days old with fever should always be admitted to the hospital and started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics until a source is identified and treatment narrowed.**\n\nInfants **22–60 days old** with a fever should be admitted and started on empiric antibiotics **if inflammatory markers are abnormal**. If inflammatory markers are normal in this age group, **hospital admission and empiric antibiotics depend on the patient’s clinical status, lab results, and physician preference.**\n\nOnce a source is identified, **treatment is narrowed** to treat the specific infection. For **bacterial infections**, antibiotic treatment is determined based on **culture results**, if available. For **viral etiologies**, antivirals may be necessary, or the patient may solely need **supportive care such as oxygen support**."

After multiple hours of active labor, the fetus developed bradycardia, and the decision was made to proceed with operative vaginal delivery using forceps. The mother has a history of hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination of the neonate shows asymmetry of the face upon crying, with incomplete closure of the left eye. Upon feeding, he starts drooling from the left side of the mouth.

Patients usually present with **asymmetric facial expressions, difficulty feeding, and incomplete eye closure**. Associated findings include **ecchymosis, hemotympanum, facial swelling**, and **head molding**. \n\n**Traumatic congenital facial nerve paralysis usually resolves spontaneously** and does not require intervention. If the patient’s eye does not close all the way, an **eye pad and eye drops** are used to prevent **corneal damage**.\n\nThere is **no guaranteed way to prevent pressure injuries** during vaginal delivery.

The rash is **benign, self-limited**, and **spontaneously resolves within 20 minutes**.\n\n**Main explanation:**\nThis three-day-old newborn girl presents with **sudden onset of an erythematous rash on the trunk with a clear demarcation along the midline** consistent with **Harlequin color change**. This benign condition is characterized by **unilateral transient color change**.    \n\nPatients with Harlequin color change have **sudden onset of unilateral redness** that typically **resolves within 20 minutes**. On physical examination, when the infant is placed on their side, **unilateral erythema is seen on the dependent side with a clear demarcation along the midline**. **Blanching** can be observed on the nondependent side. While the color change may appear dramatic, this phenomenon is **benign, self-limited, and does not require intervention**.\n\nThe cause of Harlequin color change is **unknown**, but it may be related to **immaturity of autonomic regulation** of cutaneous blood vessel tone.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of global developmental delay. Patients often have characteristic physical features, including a long narrow face and large protruding ears.\n\nGlobal developmental delay is present when there are delays in two or more of the major categories of development (motor, language/speech, cognitive and social/emotional).\n\nWhen assessing pediatric developmental milestones, the first step is obtaining a focused history and physical exam. Understanding normal developmental milestones based on age can help physicians and caregivers recognize when a child is at risk for developmental delay and would benefit from detailed evaluation and early intervention. Reviewing birth history is important since both prematurity and low birth weight are associated with developmental delays. Interval history is useful to determine new skills learned or if there is any regression in development. Family history can reveal genetic causes of developmental delay. Genetic conditions associated with developmental delays include fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome (trisomy 21), tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, and autism spectrum disorder.\n\nWhen performing the physical exam, reflexes, muscle tone, and balance should be checked. The child's behavior and social interactions should be observed. Patients with fragile X syndrome can exhibit autistic behaviors, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, aggression, and poor eye contact. Patients with developmental delays should also be assessed for characteristic physical features.  Physical features associated with fragile X syndrome include a long, narrow face, prominent jaw, and forehead, hyperflexible fingers, and large protruding ears."

  "explanation": "Major takeaway\nPatients with early localized Lyme disease can present with a bull’s eye rash (known as erythema migrans). A presumptive diagnosis of early localized Lyme disease can be made in patients with the classic rash who have been to or live in a Lyme endemic area. Treatment can be initiated without the need for laboratory confirmation.\n\nMain explanation\nThis 12-year-old boy who lives in Connecticut and was recently hiking presents with fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, headache, and a bull's eye rash consistent with erythema migrans (EM). The presence of EM rash indicates early localized Lyme disease. Treatment should be started immediately in early localized Lyme disease as no testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment.\n\nPatients with Lyme disease may report a tick bite or travel to a Lyme-endemic area. Erythema migrans appear with early localized Lyme disease within days to two weeks after an infected tick bite. The skin lesion begins as a red or purple-colored macule or papule and expands with enhanced central erythema. It may appear as a bull’s eye lesion, as in this case. The Rash is often non-painful and non-pruritic and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as fever, malaise, headache, stiff neck, myalgias, and arthralgias. Carditis with a prolonged PR interval on electrocardiography is a manifestation of early disseminated lyme disease. The most common manifestation of late Lyme disease, which occurs weeks to months after the initial infection, is arthritis, which is typically monoarticular, and affects the large joints, particularly the knee.\n\nThe diagnostic evaluation of children who present with fever and rash involves narrowing down the most likely etiology based on history and physical exam including rash morphology. If the characteristic erythema migrans (bull’s eye lesion) rash is seen, and the patient lives in or has been to a lyme endemic area, and there are no signs or symptoms of early disseminated or late disease, then no further work-up is required before treatment. If the patient has signs and symptoms of early disseminated or late Lyme disease, serology testing for Borrelia burgdorferi with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with reflex to Western immunoblot should be performed. Positive serology confirms a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Repeat testing is recommended several weeks later if initial testing is negative due to low sensitivity of serologic testing in early disease."

Acute management involves fluid resuscitation and administration of intravenous antibiotics with appropriate coverage against Staphylococcus species (including S. aureus).  \n\nMain explanation\nThis patient presents with findings consistent with Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), including a characteristic desquamating rash (without mucous membrane involvement), fever, and irritability. Most cases occur before the age of 6 years. Acute management of this condition includes administration of an intravenous antibiotic with appropriate coverage against Staphylococcus species, such as nafcillin or oxacillin.  \n\nSSSS and impetigo are common pediatric skin infections that are most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus. While impetigo usually results from direct bacterial invasion of the skin or minor skin trauma, SSSS is caused by the hematogenous spread of staphylococcal exotoxins from colonized areas to distal sites. Exam findings can be used to distinguish mild staphylococcal infections, such as impetigo, from more severe infections, like SSSS.  \n\nAcute management of each condition differs significantly. Patients with SSSS are much more likely to present with critical illness, superimposed sepsis, and significant fluid loss from desquamated skin and temperature dysregulation. Therefore, these patients require special attention to airway, breathing, and circulation before further management. Once stabilized, patients with SSSS should be admitted to the hospital and receive intravenous fluids and antibiotic therapy targeted at Staphylococcus species. Since most strains of S. aureus produce penicillinase, a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic, such as nafcillin or oxacillin, is preferred. If risk factors are present for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or if the local prevalence of MRSA is high, vancomycin should be considered. Additional management includes application of mupirocin to the nares if S. aureus colonization is suspected, as well as pain control and wound management."

Physical exam findings may include dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and delayed capillary refill, in addition to low urine output and urine osmolality > 750 mOsm/kg.\n\nMain explanation\nThis patient in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on mechanical ventilation and in a radiant warmer has hyperextension of the neck consistent with opisthotonus posturing from muscle spasms, irritability, tachycardia, delayed capillary refill, and decreased urine output. These findings, along with the laboratory results showing hypernatremia and urine osmolality > 750 mOsm/kg, are consistent with hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to insensible fluid loss likely from mechanical ventilation and radiant warmer.\n\nWhen evaluating hypernatremia in a patient, it is important to assess the volume status to determine if the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. In the setting of hypovolemic hypernatremia, the history in addition to measuring urine output and urine osmolality will help determine the etiology.\n\nLow urine output and urine osmolality > 750 mOsm/kg suggest extrarenal fluid loss. If the patient is on mechanical ventilation or a radiant warmer, such as in this case, the underlying cause of hyponatremia is likely insensible fluid loss. Extensive burns, excessive sweating, fever, and phototherapy also increase insensible fluid loss.\n\nInadequate intake and inability to communicate thirst or impaired thirst mechanism may also result in hypovolemic hypernatremia. Patients with gastroenteritis, on nasogastric tube with suction and using osmotic cathartics such as lactulose can develop hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to gastrointestinal fluid loss. Physical exam findings often include tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, and decreased skin turgor. High urine output > 4 ml/kg/hr and urine osmolality < 750 mOsm/kg suggest renal fluid losses as seen in patients using diuretics or mannitol, post-obstructive diuresis, or acute tubular necrosis with polyuria."

Tracheoesophageal fistula is most commonly associated with other congenital anomalies such as VACTERL associations, which include vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal, and limb abnormalities like absent thumbs and are usually classified according to their anatomic configuration. In Type C tracheoesophageal fistula, which is the most common type, patients have a proximal esophageal pouch and a distal tracheoesophageal fistula.\n\nWhen assessing newborn patients with respiratory distress the ABCDE assessment should be performed. If patients are stable, then the focus should be on identifying the etiology of respiratory distress. Focused history, physical exam, and pulse oximetry should be checked. In this patient, history reveals polyhydramnios on the prenatal ultrasound. The physical exam reveals tachypnea, grunting, and mucous bubbling from the nose and the mouth. Gastric distention and feeding difficulties are other signs of tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia. Physical examination of a newborn with respiratory distress should focus on assessing chest and lung examination, skin color (cyanosis or meconium stained), heart murmurs, peripheral pulses, and associated anomalies such as VACTREL features (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal, and limb abnormalities). Congenital anomalies consistent with VACTERL include a single artery in the umbilical cord, anal atresia, and absent thumbs.\n\nIn newborn patients with early-onset respiratory distress, the inability to pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube suggests esophageal atresia. The absence of the fetal stomach bubble and maternal polyhydramnios are common prenatal ultrasound findings. Chest x-ray at birth may show a coiled tube within the esophagus and an air-distended stomach, indicating an associated tracheoesophageal fistula."

If bone age is ≥ 2 standard deviations above the child’s chronological age, as in this case, precocious puberty can be diagnosed, and labs should be obtained to determine if the child has central or peripheral precocious puberty.\n\nTo help differentiate central from peripheral precocious puberty, LH, FSH, and testosterone levels should be checked. If pubertal levels are noted, central precocious puberty can be diagnosed, and thyroid levels and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be checked to determine the etiology. If prepubertal levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone (low LH and FSH and elevated testosterone) are noted, peripheral precocious puberty can be diagnosed. Exogenous steroid exposure from use of oral contraceptives, testosterone transdermal patches, and (occasionally) tea tree oil and lavender can lead to peripheral precocious puberty.

In any pediatric patient with a suspected medication exposure, the first and most critical step is to perform an ABCDE assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) to ensure stabilization.\n\nThis approach ensures that life-threatening issues, such as airway compromise, inadequate breathing, and poor circulation, are addressed immediately.

Chest x-ray should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of respiratory distress.\n\nMain explanation\nThis newborn with a maternal history of gestational diabetes who was delivered by cesarean section presents with respiratory distress beyond 6 hours of life. This is consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), which can be confirmed by obtaining a chest x-ray that shows fluid in the horizontal fissures of the lungs.\n\nTTN is caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth, which leads to ineffective gas exchange and respiratory distress. Risk factors for TTN include cesarean delivery, precipitous delivery, and maternal diabetes. TTN typically presents shortly after birth with respiratory distress and persists beyond 6 hours of life. If symptoms resolve within the first 6 hours of life, then it is classified as delayed transition of the newborn. Typical physical exam findings include tachypnea, grunting, retractions, hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementation, and diffuse crackles in bilateral lung fields.\n\nThe diagnostic workup for an infant with respiratory distress should include obtaining labs such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood gas. A CBC may help rule out anemia and infections such as neonatal sepsis and neonatal pneumonia. In this newborn, the CBC shows no evidence of anemia or leukocytosis. Blood gas is obtained to evaluate gas exchange and acid-base balance. The blood gas in this patient shows mild respiratory acidosis which is expected with transient tachypnea of the newborn.\n\nChest x-ray is essential to exclude other causes of respiratory distress in the newborn such as respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, and pneumothorax. Typical chest x-ray findings of TTN include the presence of pulmonary edema, with diffuse increased interstitial lung markings, perihilar streaking, and fluid in the horizontal fissures of the lungs. A lung ultrasound will demonstrate double lung points. An echocardiogram should be obtained if the newborn experiences persistent respiratory distress despite adequate treatment to rule out persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)."

Infection commonly occurs from drinking water from a contaminated water source or during recreational activities in a contaminated body of water.\n\nMain explanation\nThis child is presenting with classic symptoms of parasitic gastroenteritis, including frequent, greasy, and foul-smelling diarrhea (i.e. steatorrhea); malaise; flatulence; and abdominal cramps. This child likely acquired the infection from accidental water ingestion while swimming in a freshwater lake in the northern United States. The flagellated, pear-shaped protozoa seen on stool microscopy confirms the diagnosis of Giardia duodenalis.\n\nA thorough history and physical examination can provide key details in the evaluation of diarrhea in children. Acute diarrhea is usually caused by an infectious etiology, either viral (most common), bacterial, or parasitic. Diarrhea caused by a virus is usually watery in nature and without red flags (i.e. blood or mucus in stool, severe abdominal pain or dehydration, and high fevers). It is most often caused by norovirus in countries where rotavirus vaccination is routine. Norovirus is highly contagious and spreads through close contact with infected individuals through a fecal-oral route. Day care centers, schools, healthcare facilities, and cruise ships are known to be associated with outbreaks.\n\nBacterial gastroenteritis is often associated with acute bloody diarrhea or other red flags and may be caused by Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or Escherichia coli. These infections may be associated with foodborne transmission from undercooked or cross-contaminated meat. In addition to food sources, Salmonella is known for transmission from handling reptiles, rodents, and other animals.\n\nParasitic gastroenteritis can lead to either acute or chronic diarrhea and is most often caused by Giardia or Cryptosporidium. The diarrhea is usually non-bloody, watery, and it can be associated with steatorrhea. Transmission of parasitic disease primarily occurs through water, either from drinking contaminated water or during recreational activities in a contaminated body of water, such as a stream or lake."

TSC is diagnosed in a patient who exhibits characteristic ash-leaf spots (hypomelanotic macules best visualized under a Wood’s lamp) and Shagreen patches (raised lesions with an orange-peel texture, typically seen in the lumbosacral region). Some children develop facial angiofibromas on the nose and cheeks and periungual fibromas (small skin nodules under the nails). Other classic skin findings in neurocutaneous syndromes include the cafe-au-lait spots (hyperpigmented macules) seen in neurofibromatosis and the port-wine stains seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome.\n\nTo help differentiate the etiology of neurocutaneous syndromes, both neurological and ophthalmological examinations should be performed. If retinal hamartomas are identified, a diagnosis of TSC is likely. When physical examination findings are highly suggestive of TSC, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, along with cardiac and renal ultrasounds, should be ordered to evaluate for non-cutaneous manifestations of TSC."

Nasal polyps are often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis secondary to chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\nWhen evaluating children who present with signs and symptoms of lower airway obstruction, it is important to assess the onset of pulmonary symptoms, specifically determining if symptoms have been present since birth and, if not, determining if they have acute onset, subacute onset, or gradual chronic onset. Causes of lower respiratory obstruction that have acute onset include anaphylaxis and bronchiolitis. Chronic diseases that present in childhood with lower airway obstruction and gradual onset of symptoms include cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, tracheobronchomalacia, and asthma. These may be further differentiated by their triggers. For example, position changes, specifically the supine position, triggers stridor and monophonic wheezing associated with tracheobronchomalacia; and environmental changes, such as cold air and pollen, can trigger wheezing associated with asthma.\n\nOn physical exam, patients with suspected lower airway obstruction should be assessed for signs of increased work of breathing and impending respiratory distress. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation should be monitored, and patients should be assessed for wheezing, crackles, and rhonchi on lung auscultation.\n\nPatients with cystic fibrosis typically have a history of chronic cough and symptoms consistent with recurrent respiratory infections, including rhinosinusitis and pneumonia. They may have poor weight gain/failure to thrive due to pancreatic insufficiency, preventing the digestion of food. As a result, on physical examination, they often have nasal polyps from recurrent sinopulmonary infections; wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi on lung exam; digital clubbing if hypoxia is present; and abdominal distension."

If hearing loss is diagnosed, referral to audiology for further evaluation is warranted.\n\nMain explanation\nThis 4-year-old child has delays in speech and language secondary to hearing loss with normal motor, cognitive, and social milestones. At 4 years old, a child should be able to define five words, name four colors, and all speech should be understood by strangers. Children with hearing loss should be referred to audiology for further evaluation.\n\nSpeech and language delay is defined as children falling behind recognized milestones for age. There are multiple causes of speech delay, which can be classified into neurologic, otologic and psychologic. Neurologic factors that may cause speech delay include TORCH intrauterine infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex), maternal drug exposure, prematurity, hypoxia, birth trauma, neonatal jaundice, meningitis, head trauma, and seizures. Otologic causes may include recurrent otitis media, and exposure to ototoxic drugs, such as gentamycin in this patient. Family history of hearing loss and speech delay indicate metabolic or recessive inherited conditions. Autism spectrum disorders are associated with speech and language delay, impaired social interactions, and repetitive behaviors.\n\nPatients with speech and language delay should be evaluated with a focus on birth history, family history and developmental milestones. Physical examination should include behavioral assessment, neurological and otoscopic evaluations. Isolated speech and language delay is diagnosed when a child exhibits a significant delay in speech development, but maintains normal comprehension, intelligence, and social-emotional skills. To help differentiate the causes of speech delay without other developmental delays, a hearing test should initially be performed. If hearing loss is diagnosed, the next step is referral to audiology for further evaluation and implementation of interventional programs."

Rheumatic heart disease is confirmed by the transthoracic echocardiogram finding of pathologic mitral regurgitation, chordal thickening, and restricted leaflet motion. The patient is currently asymptomatic, so no symptomatic therapy is indicated. Monthly intramuscular Penicillin is indicated to prevent additional episodes of acute rheumatic fever and worsening of rheumatic heart disease.\n\nWhen a formal diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is confirmed based on the Jones criteria, treatment is multimodal. Penicillin serves as the mainstay of antibiotic treatment. In addition, these patients require secondary antibiotic prophylaxis, to reduce the risk of new group A streptococcus infections. Subsequent episodes of acute rheumatic fever can lead to valvular disease and rheumatic heart disease which is a late sequela of acute rheumatic fever. Acute rheumatic fever also often requires anti-inflammatory medications to treat symptoms like arthritis.\n\nRheumatic heart disease typically presents years after the initial illness. When confirmed via transthoracic echocardiogram, treatment involves symptomatic therapy with diuretics and beta blockers, as well as secondary antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients with progressive disease or those with significant symptoms should be considered for surgical valve replacement."

A common physical examination finding associated with this diagnosis is pain with manipulation of the pinna.\n\nOtitis, or inflammation of the ear, is commonly caused by bacterial infections and is most often seen in children, but it can occur at any age. Pediatric patients typically present with either acute otitis media, which is an infection of the middle ear most commonly caused by Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae; or acute otitis externa, which is an infection of the outer ear canal that is usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nHistorical findings associated with otitis media include increased fussiness, appetite changes, trouble sleeping, as well as tugging, rubbing or holding the affected ear in non-verbal patients. Verbal patients will report new onset ear pain (otalgia) with or without ear drainage, fever, as well as preceding symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. rhinorrhea, congestion, cough). Physical examination findings specific to this diagnosis include an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane with impaired mobility. Purulent drainage may occur if the tympanic membrane has ruptured.\n\nIn contrast, historical findings associated with otitis externa include new onset ear pain with a sense of “fullness” and decreased hearing, with or without otorrhea. Patients will often report a history of recent swimming, or manipulation of the ear canal (e.g. use of Q-tips or instrumentation). Physical examination will reveal pain with manipulation of the pinna, which is not typically observed in patients with otitis media. In addition, patients typically have edema, erythema, otorrhea, and associated debris from the ear canal."

  "explanation": "Major takeaway\nCystic fibrosis and pulmonary ciliary dyskinesia are associated with recurrent respiratory and sinus infections that present at a young age, and infertility. Patients with cystic fibrosis also may exhibit findings associated with pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nMain explanation\nThis patient has a history of meconium ileus, chronic constipation, and recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections. On physical examination nasal polyps and rhonchi are present. These findings along with a family history of pulmonary disease make cystic fibrosis the most likely diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) can also cause pancreatic insufficiency which can lead to bulky, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea).\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in a defect in chloride channels affecting organs with secretory functions like the lungs and pancreas. Due to the defect in chloride channels, abnormally viscous secretions that are thick and sticky are produced. This primarily impairs airway clearance and increases the risk of respiratory infection. It often results in pancreatic insufficiency leading to steatorrhea characterized by frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily, and failure to thrive or poor weight gain due to malabsorption of fat and protein. Patients may also experience acute or recurrent pancreatitis and focal biliary cirrhosis. Newborns with CF may present with meconium ileus or prolonged jaundice. On physical examination, patients with CF can have evidence of nasal polyps, digital clubbing, rales or rhonchi on lung exam, and hepatomegaly. Patients may also have rectal prolapse. Chest x-ray may show bronchiectasis.\n\nPatients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) also present with recurrent sinopulmonary infections. These patients are also prone to recurrent otitis media with or without hearing loss and may have situs inversus. PCD is associated with abnormal ciliary movement. Newborns with primary ciliary dyskinesia often have mild respiratory distress and may require supplemental oxygen for a few hours to days after birth. On physical examination, patients can have nasal polyps, digital clubbing, and middle ear effusions. Chest x-ray can show bronchiectasis.\n\nBoth CF and PCD are associated with infertility. Infertility in males with CF is due to the congenital absence of the vas deferens. Women with CF can develop secondary amenorrhea and hyperviscous reproductive tract mucus which impairs fertility. Patients with PCD can develop infertility due to the immotility of sperm and abnormal ciliary motion within the fallopian tubes and endometrium."

Obtaining an arterial blood gas analysis is the most appropriate next step to assess the severity of respiratory compromise and degree of compensation which can guide further management.\n\nRespiratory failure can be classified as hypoxemic respiratory failure, (e.g. lung failure), and hypercapnic respiratory failure, (respiratory pump failure). In a patient with suspected respiratory failure, an arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) is the initial diagnostic test of choice to assess acid-base balance, oxygenation, and carbon dioxide retention.\n\nIf the ABG reveals an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg, the patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure. This often results from a mismatch in alveolar ventilation and perfusion (V/Q mismatch) such as in patients with asthma, interstitial edema or fibrosis, atelectasis, and pneumonia. If the ABG reveals an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) > 50 mmHg, this indicates hypercapnic respiratory failure. This condition is characterized by inadequate ventilation and carbon dioxide retention. Hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure often occur together as many disease processes induce physiologic changes that impair both oxygenation and ventilation. In these cases, the ABG will demonstrate both decreased PaO2 and increased PaCO2."
