        "correct": "A",
        "correct": "A",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: A. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)**\n\n**Why it's correct:**\nThe first priority in a new neck mass—particularly in patients over 40—is to distinguish benign from malignant pathology. Although high-resolution ultrasound best characterizes size, shape, consistency, and vascularity, when ultrasound-guided sampling is not explicitly listed, FNAC offers a minimally invasive, rapid way to obtain cytology using a fine gauge needle under imaging guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n**B. CT scan of the neck** – Although CT is valuable after cytological diagnosis to assess tumour bulk, local invasion, and nodal spread, it is not the first test for obtaining tissue.\n\n**C. MRI of the head and neck** – MRI provides superior soft-tissue detail for surgical planning but is not indicated before confirming pathology via cytology.\n\n**D. X-ray of the neck** – Plain films lack sensitivity for soft-tissue masses and offer little diagnostic value in this setting.\n\n**E. Sialography** – This technique outlines the salivary ductal system to detect stones or ductal inflammation. In an asymptomatic patient with a submandibular lump, duct obstruction or sialadenitis is unlikely, so sialography is unnecessary.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostic Approach:**\n\n- **Step 1: Ultrasound** to characterize the lesion’s size, borders, consistency, vascularity, and relation to surrounding structures.\n- **Step 2: Ultrasound-guided FNAC** for cytological analysis. Under local anesthesia, a 22–25 gauge needle is inserted into the mass multiple times to aspirate cellular material, minimizing patient discomfort and reducing bleeding risk.\n- **Step 3: Cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI)** only after FNAC confirms pathology, to evaluate tumour extent, local invasion, and regional lymphadenopathy.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\nFNAC has a sensitivity of approximately 80–90% and specificity over 90% for detecting malignancy in head and neck masses. If cytology is nondiagnostic or suggests lymphoma, core‐needle biopsy or excisional biopsy may be required for immunohistochemical studies and flow cytometry. Complications are rare but include hematoma, infection, and very small risk of tumor seeding along the needle tract.\n\nPatient preparation is minimal: coagulation status should be checked in anticoagulated individuals, and the procedure is performed in the outpatient setting. Results are typically available within 48–72 hours, allowing prompt planning for further imaging or referral to ENT/head-and-neck surgery.\n\nFollow-up of indeterminate or suspicious FNAC findings involves multidisciplinary discussion. Correlation with clinical examination, imaging, and, if needed, repeat biopsy ensures accurate diagnosis. Once malignancy is confirmed, CT or MRI guides staging and surgical planning, and PET–CT may be added for distant metastasis evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nIn adult patients with a new, painless neck mass, after initial ultrasound assessment, ultrasound-guided FNAC is the preferred first investigation to establish a tissue diagnosis with minimal morbidity. Subsequent CT or MRI is reserved for preoperative staging once cytology results are known.\n\n---\n\n",

  ],
  "correct": "D",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. Metastatic bone cancer**\n\n**Why it's correct:**\nThis patient’s marked hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH and elevated alkaline phosphatase points to a PTH-independent cause of calcium elevation with increased bone turnover. Metastatic lesions—particularly from breast, prostate, or lung primaries—often produce local osteolysis and release calcium and ALP into the circulation. Tumour infiltration and bone destruction drive the high ALP, while PTH is appropriately suppressed in response to the elevated calcium.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n**A. Vitamin D excess** – Excess vitamin D raises both calcium and phosphate and typically causes a **high or normal PTH** picture is suppressed, but ALP remains normal unless there is coexisting bone disease. Our patient’s raised ALP reflects bone destruction rather than vitamin D–mediated increased gut absorption alone.\n\n**B. Multiple myeloma** – While myeloma can cause hypercalcemia, it usually presents with **normal or slightly elevated ALP** (unless fractures are present) and accompanied by anemia, renal dysfunction, or monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis, none of which are seen here.\n\n**C. Sarcoidosis** – Granulomatous disease can raise calcium via increased 1α-hydroxylase activity in macrophages, but ALP is generally normal and PTH is low. There would also be other systemic signs such as pulmonary symptoms, lymphadenopathy, or uveitis.\n\n**E. Primary hyperparathyroidism** – Characterized by elevated PTH with hypercalcemia; here PTH is suppressed, excluding a parathyroid-driven process.\n\n**Further evaluation and management:**\nOnce PTH-independent hypercalcemia is identified, measure PTHrP and perform targeted imaging (X-ray, CT or bone scan) to localize potential malignancy. Serum protein electrophoresis and light-chain assays help exclude myeloma if clinical suspicion remains. Management focuses on volume repletion, bisphosphonates or denosumab to inhibit bone resorption, and treating the underlying malignancy.\n\n**Key teaching point:**\nIn hypercalcemia with **low PTH**, look for PTHrP-secreting tumours or osteolytic metastases. Elevated ALP suggests active bone turnover, favoring metastatic bone disease over vitamin D excess or granulomatous causes."

    { "label": "E", "text": "Administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor" }
  ],
  "correct": "D",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics**\n\n**Why it's correct:**\nIn a chemotherapy patient roughly two weeks post-treatment, diarrhea and fever strongly suggest neutropenic enterocolitis or early neutropenic sepsis—even before the absolute neutrophil count is known. Delaying treatment while awaiting lab results can be fatal. Empiric, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics that cover Gram-negative rods and anaerobes (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam) should be initiated immediately to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n**A. Abdominal X-ray** – Reserved for suspected complications such as bowel perforation or obstruction. The priority here is infection control, not imaging.\n\n**B. Wait for the results of the full blood count** – Neutropenic patients may not mount a typical leukocytosis. Management of febrile neutropenia must begin empirically.\n\n**C. Stool culture for Clostridioides difficile** – While C. difficile testing is reasonable, results take time and should not delay empiric therapy in a high-risk, febrile neutropenic host.\n\n**E. Administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor** – G-CSF can help shorten the duration of neutropenia but is not first-line for acute febrile neutropenia and does nothing immediately to control infection.\n\n---\n\n**Further Diagnostic and Management Considerations:**\n\n1. **Blood and stool cultures** should be obtained prior to antibiotic administration but should not delay treatment.  \n2. **IV fluid resuscitation** and close monitoring of vital signs and organ function are essential.  \n3. **Add antifungal therapy** if fever persists beyond 4–7 days despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, or if imaging suggests fungal involvement.  \n4. **Consider CT abdomen** only if there is worsening pain, signs of perforation, or lack of response to antibiotics after 48 hours.\n\n---\n\n**Key Teaching Point:**\nAny febrile patient within 7–14 days post-chemotherapy presenting with systemic symptoms—regardless of initial blood counts—should be presumed neutropenic and treated emergently with broad-spectrum IV antibiotics to cover Pseudomonas and other opportunistic pathogens."

  ],
  "correct": "B",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: B. Dexamethasone**\n\nDexamethasone is the glucocorticoid of choice for symptomatic cerebral oedema caused by brain metastases. Its high potency, long half-life, and minimal mineralocorticoid activity rapidly reduce vasogenic swelling, relieve raised intracranial pressure, and improve headache, nausea, and other neurological symptoms.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **A. Haloperidol** – An antipsychotic with no role in reducing intracranial pressure or tumour-related oedema.\n- **C. Hydrocortisone** – A physiologic steroid preparation that lacks sufficient anti-inflammatory potency and has greater mineralocorticoid effects, making it suboptimal for cerebral oedema.\n- **D. Metoclopramide** – Although an antiemetic, it does not address the underlying intracranial hypertension and may worsen extrapyramidal side effects when used with steroids.\n- **E. Prednisolone** – While a systemic steroid, it is less potent and has more mineralocorticoid activity than dexamethasone, resulting in slower symptom relief and greater fluid retention.\n\n**Clinical Notes:**\n- Typical starting dose is 8 mg IV once, followed by 4 mg IV every 6 hours (or equivalent oral dosing) with gradual taper over 1–2 weeks as symptoms improve.\n- Monitor blood glucose, appetite, mood changes, and signs of infection during steroid therapy.\n\n**Key Point:**\nIn patients with symptomatic brain metastases and vasogenic oedema, prompt initiation of dexamethasone is essential to relieve raised intracranial pressure and improve quality of life."

  ],
  "correct": "A",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: A. Nasogastric tube**\n\nIn malignant bowel obstruction with intractable vomiting of fecal contents and marked distension, decompression via an indwelling nasogastric tube provides rapid symptomatic relief by evacuating secretions and gas, reducing vomiting, and improving patient comfort. Although sometimes considered undignified in palliative care, it is the most effective measure when surgical options are contraindicated by diffuse disease and ascites.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **B. Intravenous fluids** – Essential for hydration and electrolyte correction, but does not relieve mechanical obstruction or stop feculent vomiting.\n- **C. Subcutaneous hyoscine butylbromide** – An antispasmodic that can reduce colicky pain but will not decompress the gut or prevent ongoing vomiting of fecal material.\n- **D. Oral cyclizine** – An antiemetic that requires absorption beyond the obstruction; ineffective when oral intake is impossible and vomiting persists.\n- **E. Palliative stoma** – Surgical stoma formation may palliate single‐level obstruction, but is high risk in diffuse peritoneal disease with ascites and poor performance status.\n\n---\n\n**Further Management Considerations:**\n\n- **Medication adjuncts:** After decompression, symptom control includes continuous subcutaneous infusion of hyoscine butylbromide (80–120 mg/24 h) for spasms, subcutaneous cyclizine for nausea, and opioids (e.g., diamorphine) for pain.\n- **Fluid and electrolyte monitoring:** Carefully balance IV fluids to maintain hydration without worsening ascites.\n- **Multidisciplinary approach:** Engage palliative care, dietetics, and nursing to optimize comfort, address oral secretion management, and discuss goals of care.\n\n---\n\n**Key Teaching Point:**\nIn advanced malignant bowel obstruction with feculent vomiting and contraindications to surgery, nasogastric decompression is the cornerstone of palliative management, complemented by parenteral antispasmodics, antiemetics, and analgesia to maximize patient comfort."

  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine**\n\n**Why it's correct:**\nThis presentation of rapidly progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, sensory level, and urinary retention in a patient with known metastatic cancer is highly suggestive of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. MRI of the entire spine is the most sensitive and specific modality to identify the level, extent, and nature of cord or root compression, and to guide urgent neurosurgical or radiation therapy planning.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **A. Spinal CT with contrast** – CT may demonstrate bony metastases but lacks the soft-tissue resolution needed to visualise epidural tumour, cord oedema, or nerve root involvement.\n- **B.

Bone scintigraphy** – Detects areas of increased osteoblastic activity throughout the skeleton, but cannot localise epidural masses or assess the spinal cord and nerve roots in real time.\n- **E. Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis** – Useful for visceral or pelvic pathology, but irrelevant for evaluating spinal pathology or neurological deficits.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach:**\n1. **Urgent MRI** allows precise mapping of metastatic epidural disease, spinal canal compromise, and planning for decompression or radiotherapy.\n2. **High-dose corticosteroids** (e.g., dexamethasone 16 mg IV bolus followed by 4 mg IV q6h) should be administered immediately to reduce vasogenic oedema and preserve neurological function.\n3. **Neurosurgical and radiation oncology consultation** must occur emergently; decompressive laminectomy or targeted radiotherapy can be delivered based on MRI findings.\n\n---\n\n**Key Teaching Point:**\nIn any cancer patient with signs of acute myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome, do not delay—obtain an MRI of the whole spine immediately, start high-dose steroids, and arrange definitive oncologic management without awaiting other imaging or blood tests."

In this patient with known glioblastoma, the progressive morning headaches and associated nausea reflect increased intracranial pressure from fluid leaking into the interstitial space. Dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity, stabilises the blood–brain barrier, reduces capillary permeability, and rapidly shrinks peritumoural swelling.

  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: A. Capecitabine**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nCapecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil widely used in colorectal and breast malignancies, offering the convenience of an oral regimen in place of continuous infusional fluorouracil. It undergoes hepatic conversion to fluorouracil and exerts cytotoxic effects on rapidly dividing gut mucosal cells as well as tumour cells. Diarrhoea is one of its most frequent adverse effects; if not promptly managed, fluid losses can outpace intake and lead to significant dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. When a patient develops intractable, high-volume diarrhoea despite optimal supportive measures—antidiarrhoeals and fluid encouragement—the offending agent must be withheld to prevent further complications.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **B. Loperamide** is the first-line antidiarrhoeal for chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea; stopping it would remove the primary symptomatic therapy without addressing the underlying cause.\n- **C. Allopurinol** is not typically associated with diarrhoea; in fact, xanthine oxidase inhibition can reduce uric acid burden during tumour lysis and has no role in exacerbating gastrointestinal fluid loss here.\n- **D. Codeine** generally causes constipation via µ-opioid receptor–mediated slowing of intestinal transit, making it an unlikely contributor to diarrhoeal symptoms.\n- **E. Rivaroxaban** has been taken without issue for 15 years and is not known to induce diarrhoea; its discontinuation would risk thromboembolic complications without improving the patient’s gastrointestinal status.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology of Capecitabine-Induced Diarrhoea:**\n1. **Mucosal injury:** Fluorouracil damages rapidly dividing enterocytes, leading to mucosal atrophy, reduced absorption, and secretory diarrhoea.  \n2. **Inflammatory component:** Cytotoxic injury prompts local inflammation, increasing intestinal permeability and fluid exudation.  \n3. **Dose-dependence:** Severity correlates with cumulative exposure and individual variability in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostics and Grading:**\n- **Clinical assessment:** Quantify stool frequency, volume, and associated symptoms (cramping, urgency).  \n- **Laboratory tests:** Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and complete blood count to detect dehydration and treatment-related cytopenias.  \n- **Grading scales:** Use CTCAE criteria to classify diarrhoea severity (Grade 1–4) and guide therapy modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Management Principles:**\n1. **Fluid and electrolyte replacement:** Encourage oral rehydration; consider IV fluids if intake is insufficient.  \n2. **Antidiarrhoeal therapy:** Loperamide or diphenoxylate-atropine as first-line agents.  \n3. **Dose adjustment or interruption:** For Grade 2–3 diarrhoea persisting > 48 hours, hold capecitabine and resume at a reduced dose once resolved to ≤ Grade 1.  \n4. **Second-line agents:** Octreotide may be used for refractory cases.  \n5. **Monitor for complications:** Watch for acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and potential sepsis in severe mucosal breakdown.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points:**\n- **Capecitabine** side effects: diarrhoea, hand–foot syndrome, mucositis, myelosuppression.  \n- **DPD deficiency** screening can identify patients at high risk for severe toxicity.  \n- **Drug interactions:** Allopurinol may theoretically alter fluoropyrimidine metabolism; coadministration should be carefully reviewed.  \n- **Supportive care** is critical—early recognition and management of diarrhoea can prevent treatment delays and hospitalisation.\n\n---\n\n**Advanced Insights:**\n- Genetic polymorphisms in DPD (encoded by DPYD) can lead to life-threatening toxicity; pharmacogenomic testing is increasingly advocated before fluoropyrimidine therapy.  \n- Research into microbiome modulation suggests that gut flora composition may influence chemotherapy tolerance and diarrhoeal risk.  \n- Emerging oral fluoropyrimidines and targeted therapies aim to maintain efficacy while reducing gastrointestinal toxicity."

MRI of the entire spine with contrast**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nIn a patient with known metastatic cancer who develops acute, progressive bilateral leg weakness, sensory level and urinary retention, spinal cord compression is the leading concern.

  "correct": "A",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: A. Dexamethasone**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nSuperior vena cava (SVC) obstruction arises when a mediastinal mass impedes venous return from the head, neck, and upper extremities, leading to facial plethora, arm edema, and distended neck and chest wall veins. Patients often develop headaches and may show cyanotic or dusky discoloration over the upper body due to impaired venous outflow. In the absence of acute airway compromise (no stridor or laryngeal edema), the immediate goal is to reduce peritumoural inflammation and edema to restore venous drainage.\n\nDexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid that stabilizes endothelial tight junctions, decreases capillary permeability, and rapidly diminishes vasogenic edema around the tumour. An initial dose of 8 mg twice daily—administered intravenously or orally—can lead to symptomatic improvement within 24–48 hours, providing relief while further diagnostic and definitive therapies are arranged. Although high-level trial data are limited, steroids remain a cornerstone of SVC syndrome management in clinical practice.\n\nCertain chemosensitive malignancies such as lymphoma may respond dramatically to corticosteroids, but ideally a tissue diagnosis should be obtained before steroid initiation, as dexamethasone can obscure histological features. When immediate biopsy is not feasible due to patient condition or anatomic constraints, empiric steroid therapy is justified to prevent complications.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **B. Endovascular stenting** provides definitive restoration of SVC patency but requires interventional radiology planning and is not the fastest way to relieve acute venous congestion.  \n- **C. Radiotherapy** can shrink radiosensitive tumours over days to weeks, but it does not offer the rapid symptom relief needed in acute SVC syndrome.  \n- **D. Chemotherapy** may be effective against chemosensitive tumours but should follow histological confirmation and does not act quickly enough to alleviate acute obstruction.  \n- **E. Antihypertensives** are irrelevant to the pathophysiology of venous obstruction and will not improve venous return or edema.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points and Key Information:**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Tumour invasion or extrinsic compression of the SVC raises upstream hydrostatic pressure, resulting in fluid transudation into the interstitial tissues (facial and arm edema), cerebral venous congestion (headache), and development of collateral venous pathways via the azygous system over weeks.  \n- **Symptom Mechanisms:** Elevated venous pressure leads to capillary leakage (edema), venous stasis (plethora, cyanosis), and increased intracranial venous pressure (headache).  \n- **Diagnostics:** Contrast-enhanced CT chest is the gold standard to confirm SVC narrowing, visualize collateral veins, and identify the causative mass.  \n- **Immediate Management:** Start high-dose dexamethasone, elevate head of bed, administer supplemental oxygen, and consider mild diuretics for fluid overload.  \n- **Definitive Therapy:** Following stabilization and biopsy, options include endovascular stenting for rapid decompression or targeted chemo-/radiotherapy based on tumour histology.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostics and Management Details:**\n1. **Imaging:** Urgent CT chest with contrast to assess anatomical extent of obstruction and collateral circulation.  \n2. **Biopsy:** Tissue sampling via fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy to guide specific therapy; steroids may be paused if lymphoma is suspected.  \n3. **Supportive Care:** Head elevation, oxygen supplementation, and close monitoring of airway and neurologic status.  \n4. **Definitive Interventions:** Endovascular stenting offers immediate relief when anatomy permits; radiotherapy or chemotherapy provide longer-term tumour control.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology in Depth:**\n- **Vascular Disruption:** Malignant infiltration disrupts normal SVC flow, increasing venous pressure in the capillary beds of the head and upper extremities.  \n- **Collateral Formation:** The azygous and hemiazygous veins gradually enlarge to bypass the obstruction, but this takes days to weeks and is insufficient in acute presentations.  \n- **Edema Formation:** Sustained hydrostatic pressure causes plasma to leak into the interstitium, producing edema and facial plethora.\n\n---\n\n**Key Teaching Point:**\nIn SVC syndrome without immediate airway compromise, high-dose dexamethasone is the first-line intervention to reduce peritumoural edema and improve venous return, offering rapid symptom relief while definitive imaging and biopsy are completed."

Dexamethasone**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nSuperior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) occurs when a mediastinal mass compresses the SVC, impeding venous return from the head, neck, and upper limbs. The resulting venous congestion produces facial and arm oedema, distended neck veins, and raised intracranial pressure—manifesting as severe, persistent headache and a feeling of fullness, especially on bending forward.

Hyoscine butylbromide** – An antispasmodic used for visceral cramping; ineffective in reducing mediastinal mass–related oedema or intracranial pressure.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points and Key Information:**  \n- **Presentation:** Progressive facial/arm swelling, headache, and neck‐vein distension in a cancer patient suggest SVCS.  \n- **Immediate therapy:** Start high-dose dexamethasone to reduce peritumoural oedema and relieve symptoms.  \n- **Supportive measures:** Elevate head of bed, administer supplemental oxygen, and monitor airway.  \n- **Definitive treatment:** After stabilisation and tissue diagnosis, consider endovascular stenting or tumour‐directed chemo-/radiotherapy based on histology.\n\n---\n\n**Clinical Features Explained:**  \n1. **Facial and arm oedema:** Raised hydrostatic venous pressure forces fluid into the interstitial space.  \n2. **Distended neck veins:** Impeded SVC flow causes venous engorgement of the jugular system.  \n3. **Headache and fullness on bending:** Increased intracranial venous pressure is exacerbated by forward flexion, worsening headache.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostics:**  \n- **Chest X-ray:** Initial clue—mediastinal widening and mass.  \n- **Contrast CT chest:** Gold standard to define the location and extent of SVC compression and collateral formation.  \n- **Tissue biopsy:** Required to guide definitive therapy; steroids may be tapered if lymphoma is identified to preserve histological detail.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology:**  \n- **Venous obstruction:** Tumour compresses SVC → increased upstream venous pressure → fluid extravasation in head/arms.  \n- **Collateral circulation:** Azygous and intercostal veins enlarge over weeks, but are insufficient in acute presentations.  \n- **Vasogenic oedema:** Breakdown of endothelial tight junctions around tumour capillaries increases permeability.\n\n---\n\n**Management:**  \n1. **First-line:** Dexamethasone 8 mg IV/PO twice daily to reduce oedema.  \n2. **Supportive care:** Elevate head, oxygen, cautious diuresis if volume overload.  \n3. **Definitive intervention:** Endovascular stent placement for rapid relief or targeted radiotherapy/chemotherapy once tissue diagnosis is established.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nIn SVCS without airway compromise, immediate dexamethasone administration is essential to rapidly reduce peritumoural oedema and improve venous return, providing symptomatic relief while planning definitive oncologic treatments."

  "correct": "B",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: B. Oral ondansetron**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most distressing side effects of cancer treatment, often driven by serotonin release from damaged enterochromaffin cells in the small intestine. Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonist that blocks serotonin at peripheral vagal nerve terminals and in the central chemoreceptor trigger zone. Oral ondansetron is highly effective for acute CINV, well tolerated, and suitable for outpatient use. If the patient vomits the dose within 30 minutes, guidelines allow a single repeat dose to maintain antiemetic coverage.\n\nIn this scenario, prescribing oral ondansetron prior to chemotherapy and continuing it for at least 24 hours afterwards provides targeted prophylaxis. Its minimal sedative properties and convenient dosing (typically 8 mg PO 30 minutes before chemotherapy) make it the first‐line choice for managing acute emesis without necessitating intravenous access.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **A. Intravenous cyclizine** is an antihistamine with anticholinergic activity used primarily for motion sickness and raised intracranial pressure; it is not recommended as first‐line for CINV.  \n- **C. Subcutaneous hyoscine butylbromide** is an antispasmodic used in bowel colic and palliative obstruction, but lacks evidence in chemotherapy‐related vomiting.  \n- **D. Intravenous haloperidol** can serve as a rescue antiemetic in refractory cases but carries extrapyramidal risks and is not first‐line for acute CINV.  \n- **E. Oral promethazine** is a sedating antihistamine occasionally used off‐label for nausea, but its anticholinergic side effects and drowsiness make it suboptimal for chemotherapy‐induced vomiting.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points and Key Information:**\n- **Classification of CINV:**  \n  - *Acute* (within 24 hours)  \n  - *Delayed* (24–72 hours)  \n  - *Anticipatory* (triggered by previous experiences)  \n  - *Breakthrough* (occurring despite prophylaxis)\n- **First‐line antiemetics:**  \n  - 5-HT₃ antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron) for acute CINV  \n  - NK₁ antagonists (aprepitant) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone) for combined prophylaxis in high‐emetogenic regimens  \n- **Ondansetron dosing:**  \n  - *Prophylaxis:* 8 mg PO 30 minutes before chemotherapy, then every 8 hours for 1–2 days  \n  - *Redosing:* Single repeat if vomited within 30 minutes of administration\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology and Mechanism:**\n- **Serotonin release:** Cytotoxic drugs damage enterocytes → 5-HT release → activation of 5-HT₃ receptors on vagal afferents.  \n- **Central integration:** Signals reach the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius → trigger emesis reflex.  \n- **Ondansetron action:** Competitively blocks 5-HT₃ receptors peripherally and centrally, interrupting the emetic signaling pathway.\n\n---\n\n**Management Approach:**\n1. **Prophylaxis:** Administer ondansetron before chemotherapy and continue for 24–48 hours.  \n2. **Breakthrough therapy:** Add dexamethasone or NK₁ antagonist if emesis persists.  \n3. **Rescue medications:** Use haloperidol, metoclopramide, or olanzapine if first‐line agents fail.  \n4. **Nonpharmacologic measures:** Small frequent meals, ginger supplements, relaxation techniques.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Insights:**\n- **DPD deficiency:** Patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mutations may experience increased toxicity from fluoropyrimidines, occasionally worsening CINV.  \n- **Emerging therapies:** NK₁ receptor antagonists and olanzapine improve control of delayed and breakthrough symptoms in high‐risk regimens."

  ],
  "correct": "E",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: E. Thyroglobulin (Tg)**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nThyroglobulin is produced exclusively by thyroid follicular cells and serves as a sensitive tumour marker after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer. At three years post-surgery, Tg levels should be virtually undetectable. A measurable Tg of 5.6 µg/L strongly suggests residual or recurrent thyroid tissue—most concerning for recurrent or metastatic papillary carcinoma. Since over 90% of recurrences occur within five years, this finding mandates prompt investigation.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **Free T₃** and **Free T₄** are within their reference ranges, indicating euthyroid status on levothyroxine replacement.  \n- **TSH** is appropriately suppressed (0.1 mU/L) in a patient on thyroid hormone suppression therapy to reduce recurrence risk; a low TSH in this context is expected, not pathologic.  \n- **Calcium** at 2.6 mmol/L is at the upper limit of normal and could reflect slight assay variation; it does not carry the same oncologic significance as a rising Tg in a post-thyroidectomy patient.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points:**\n1. **Thyroglobulin monitoring:** After total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation, Tg should be < 1 µg/L; rising levels indicate recurrence.  \n2. **TSH suppression therapy:** Maintaining TSH in the lower half of normal reduces the risk of papillary carcinoma relapse.  \n3. **Calcium levels:** Monitor for hypocalcaemia post-thyroidectomy due to possible hypoparathyroidism, but mild elevations are uncommon and of less immediate concern than Tg.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology, Diagnostics & Management:**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Papillary thyroid carcinoma arises from follicular cells that secrete Tg; remnant or metastatic cells continue Tg production after thyroidectomy.  \n- **Diagnostics:** An elevated Tg warrants neck ultrasound to detect cervical recurrence and a diagnostic radioiodine scan to localise distant disease. Anti-thyroglobulin antibody levels should also be measured, as they can interfere with Tg assays.  \n- **Management:** Confirm recurrence with imaging-guided fine-needle aspiration if a suspicious nodule is identified. Treat local recurrence with surgical re-resection or radioiodine therapy; distant metastases may require higher-dose radioiodine, external beam radiation, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in refractory cases.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nIn follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer, Tg is the most sensitive marker for recurrence. Any detectable Tg after total thyroidectomy and ablation warrants thorough evaluation to identify and treat residual or metastatic disease early."

  "correct": "D",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: D. Teratoma**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nTeratomas are derived from pluripotent germ cells that differentiate into multiple tissue types. In this case, the presence of mature cartilage (a mesodermal derivative) alongside well‐formed glandular epithelium (an endodermal derivative) confirms a teratoma. The heterogeneous ultrasound appearance with calcifications further supports this, as mature teratomas often contain bone, teeth or cartilage leading to echogenic foci and shadowing.\n\nIn adult males, testicular teratomas are managed as malignant germ cell tumours, because even well‐differentiated elements can metastasise. Identification of multiple mature tissues on histology distinguishes teratoma from the other, more uniform testicular neoplasms.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**  \n- **A. Leydig cell tumour** – A sex cord–stromal neoplasm composed of uniform endocrine cells, often producing androgens; it does not contain heterologous tissues like cartilage or glandular epithelium.  \n- **B. Lymphoma** – Testicular lymphoma consists of sheets of lymphoid cells without differentiation into mesenchymal or epithelial structures; it typically occurs in men over 60.  \n- **C. Seminoma** – Characterised by large uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei, seminomas are homogeneous on imaging and lack calcifications or multiple tissue types.  \n- **E. Yolk sac tumour** – Displays a microcystic (reticular) pattern and Schiller–Duval bodies, with elevated alpha-fetoprotein; it does not exhibit cartilage or mature glandular elements.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points:**  \n1. **Teratoma identification:** Multiple mature tissue types (e.g., cartilage, epithelium, neural tissue) in a testicular mass are diagnostic of teratoma.  \n2. **Ultrasound features:** Heterogeneous echotexture with calcifications and cystic areas suggest a mixed germ cell tumour such as teratoma.  \n3. **Tumour markers:** Teratomas often have normal AFP and hCG levels; abnormal markers suggest mixed or other germ cell components.  \n4. **Age consideration:** Unlike prepubertal teratomas (usually benign), adult testicular teratomas are treated as malignant.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology:**  \n- **Origin:** Teratomas arise from totipotent germ cells that escape normal differentiation and form tissues from two or three germ layers.  \n- **Malignant potential:** In adult testes, even mature teratomatous elements can metastasise via lymphatic and hematogenous routes.  \n- **Calcification:** Deposition of calcium in bone or cartilage within the tumour produces the characteristic imaging appearance.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostics and Management:**  \n- **Imaging:** Scrotal ultrasound is the first‐line modality; heterogeneous lesions with calcifications raise suspicion for teratoma.  \n- **Blood tests:** Measure AFP, β-hCG, and LDH to evaluate for mixed germ cell components.  \n- **Surgery:** Radical inguinal orchiectomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic.  \n- **Staging:** Post‐orchiectomy CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and tumour markers guide the need for chemotherapy or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.  \n- **Follow-up:** Regular imaging and marker surveillance to detect recurrence.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nA testicular mass containing well‐differentiated cartilage and glandular epithelium is diagnostic of teratoma. In adult patients, radical orchiectomy and staging are essential, as even mature teratomas carry malignant potential."

  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: C. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nNeurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents—especially platinum compounds (e.g., cisplatin, oxaliplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), and vinca alkaloids (vincristine)—cause a length-dependent, sensorimotor axonopathy. In this patient, the bilateral distal paresthesias, sensory ataxia (unsteadiness), and timing (appearing within weeks to months after chemotherapy) are classic for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The stocking–glove distribution and diminished reflexes reflect dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve damage.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **A. Calcium deficiency** – Causes muscle cramps, tetany, perioral tingling, and carpopedal spasms rather than a distal symmetric neuropathy.  \n- **B. Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency** – Produces dorsal column signs (vibration/proprioception loss) and develops over years due to large body stores; the acute onset and preserved vibration sense here argue against it.  \n- **D. Diabetic neuropathy** – Presents gradually in the context of long-standing diabetes with poor glycaemic control; no history of diabetes is given.  \n- **E. Hypothyroidism** – May cause generalized myalgias and carpal tunnel syndrome, but not a symmetric, length-dependent sensory loss with gait disturbance.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points:**\n1. CIPN typically presents as a symmetric, length-dependent sensory neuropathy, often with pain, numbness, and paresthesias.  \n2. Onset is usually during treatment or within weeks to months after completion of neurotoxic chemotherapy.  \n3. Early recognition and dose modification can prevent irreversible nerve damage.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology:**\n- Chemotherapeutic agents bind neuronal microtubules and mitochondrial proteins in dorsal root ganglion neurons, disrupting axonal transport and causing “dying-back” degeneration.  \n- The longest nerve fibres (distal limbs) are affected first, leading to a stocking–glove pattern of sensory loss.\n\n**Diagnostics:**\n- **Clinical examination:** Key findings include reduced distal pain/temperature sensation, diminished reflexes, and sensory ataxia.  \n- **Electrophysiology:** Nerve conduction studies show reduced amplitude of sensory action potentials and slowed conduction velocities consistent with axonal neuropathy.\n\n**Management:**\n1. **Preventive:** Adjust chemotherapy dose or schedule; consider less neurotoxic alternatives when possible.  \n2. **Symptomatic:** Duloxetine is first-line for CIPN-related pain; gabapentin, pregabalin, or TCAs may be used.  \n3. **Supportive:** Physical and occupational therapy, assistive devices, fall prevention strategies.  \n4. **Follow-up:** Monitor for progression; neuropathy may improve over months but can become permanent if unaddressed."

  "correct": "B",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: B. Dexamethasone**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**\nTumours within the cranial vault often disrupt the blood–brain barrier, causing fluid to leak into the interstitial space and raising intracranial pressure. This increase in pressure stretches pain-sensitive meninges and triggers nausea by stimulating the brainstem vomiting centre. In glioblastoma patients, morning headaches and daily vomiting are classic signs of peritumoural oedema and elevated intracranial pressure.\n\nGlucocorticoids rapidly restore capillary integrity and decrease vasogenic swelling around malignant lesions. Dexamethasone is the preferred agent due to its potent anti-inflammatory properties and negligible mineralocorticoid effect. When given at 4 mg every six hours—either orally or intravenously—patients often report symptom relief within hours as oedema diminishes and intracranial pressure falls.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **A. Mannitol** is an osmotic diuretic used in acute herniation crises; it does not provide sustained control of steroid-responsive vasogenic oedema and carries a risk of rebound intracranial hypertension.  \n- **C. Cyclizine** can alleviate nausea via antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects but does not reduce cerebral swelling or improve headache.  \n- **D. Prochlorperazine** is a dopamine-antagonist antiemetic without any action on intracranial pressure or oedema.  \n- **E. Oxycodone** may address pain but has no impact on vasogenic oedema and can worsen nausea through opioid-induced gastroparesis.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points & Key Information:**\n1. **Raised intracranial pressure** in brain tumour patients presents with morning headache, nausea, and vomiting.  \n2. **Vasogenic oedema** results from tumour-mediated blood–brain barrier disruption, allowing plasma to collect in white matter.  \n3. **Steroid of choice:** Dexamethasone 4 mg IV/PO q6h; taper gradually over days to weeks as symptoms allow.  \n4. **Monitor** for steroid side effects: hyperglycaemia, immunosuppression, mood changes, and muscle weakness.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology, Diagnostics & Management:**\n- **Pathophysiology:** High-grade gliomas secrete VEGF and other mediators that increase capillary permeability. Disruption of endothelial tight junctions leads to vasogenic oedema and raised intracranial pressure, which impairs cerebral perfusion and causes headaches and vomiting.  \n- **Diagnostics:** Contrast-enhanced MRI is ideal to define tumour margins and quantify oedema; CT is acceptable for urgent assessment. Fundoscopy may reveal papilloedema. A detailed neurologic exam localises deficits.  \n- **Management:**  \n  1. **Immediate:** Initiate dexamethasone to reduce oedema and alleviate symptoms. Position head of bed at 30° to promote venous drainage.  \n  2. **Rescue:** Reserve mannitol for acute herniation.  \n  3. **Definitive therapy:** Once stabilised, consider focal radiotherapy or experimental therapies for inoperable glioblastoma, recognizing these work over days to weeks rather than hours.  \n  4. **Supportive care:** Monitor electrolytes, glucose, and signs of infection during prolonged steroid use.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\nIn patients with malignant brain lesions who develop worsening headache and vomiting from raised intracranial pressure, dexamethasone is the first-line intervention to rapidly reduce vasogenic oedema and improve neurologic symptoms while planning definitive oncologic treatments."

Radiotherapy**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nExternal beam radiotherapy directed at painful bone metastases provides rapid and durable relief by reducing tumour burden, decreasing periosteal stretching, and dampening local inflammatory cytokine release. In patients whose symptoms persist despite step 3 WHO analgesic ladder agents (strong opioids plus non‐opioids and adjuvants), single‐fraction or multi‐fraction radiotherapy is the next step to achieve meaningful pain reduction. Symptom relief typically begins within one to two weeks and can last for months.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**  \n- **B. Bisphosphonates** are useful adjuncts for preventing skeletal‐related events and can provide analgesia, but they require several months to exert an effect and are not the immediate next step when radiotherapy is available.  \n- **C. Dexamethasone** is indicated when there is evidence of spinal cord compression or nerve root impingement, not as a primary adjuvant for uncomplicated bone pain.  \n- **D. Gabapentin** is effective for neuropathic pain syndromes, but metastatic bone pain is nociceptive in origin, responding better to radiotherapy than to anti‐epileptic agents.  \n- **E. Vertebroplasty** may stabilise impending or actual pathological vertebral fractures, but it carries procedural risks and is reserved for mechanical instability rather than routine pain palliation when radiotherapy suffices.\n\n---\n\n**High‐Yield Points & Key Information:**  \n1. **WHO Analgesic Ladder:** After strong opioids and non‐opioids, add interventional or locoregional therapies such as radiotherapy for refractory bone pain.  \n2. **Radiotherapy Protocols:** Single‐fraction (8 Gy × 1) or multi‐fraction regimens (e.g., 20 Gy in 5 fractions) are equally effective for pain; choice depends on logistics and life expectancy.  \n3. **Bisphosphonates & Denosumab:** Reserved for long‐term prevention of skeletal complications; analgesic benefit is secondary and delayed.  \n4. **Vertebroplasty:** Consider only for patients with intractable mechanical pain due to vertebral collapse or fracture not amenable to radiotherapy alone.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology, Diagnostics & Management:**  \n- **Pathophysiology:** Tumour cells in bone stimulate osteoclast‐mediated resorption, leading to microfractures, periosteal irritation, and release of pro‐inflammatory mediators that activate nociceptors.  \n- **Diagnostics:** Imaging (CT, MRI, bone scan) confirms location and extent of metastases; laboratory tests assess markers of bone turnover.  \n- **Management Steps:**  \n  1. **Pharmacologic:** Optimize opioids and NSAIDs; consider adjuvants based on pain characteristics.  \n  2. **Locoregional:** Radiotherapy is first‐line for focal bone pain unresponsive to drugs.  \n  3. **Bone‐modifying agents:** Bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce fracture risk and hypercalcaemia but are not rapid analgesics.  \n  4. **Interventional:** Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for structural vertebral collapse with mechanical pain.  \n  5. **Supportive:** Physical therapy, psychosocial support, and multidisciplinary palliative care engagement.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nIn metastatic bone pain refractory to optimized analgesia, targeted radiotherapy offers the most effective and timely relief, addressing the underlying tumour‐driven nociceptive mechanisms."

  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: B. Serum calcium**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nIn a patient with malignancy who develops depression, lethargy, anorexia, polyuria or polydipsia and constipation, hypercalcaemia must be suspected. Excessive calcium in the bloodstream disrupts neuronal and smooth muscle function, giving rise to the neuropsychiatric (lethargy, depression) and gastrointestinal (constipation, anorexia) symptoms seen here. Measuring serum calcium is the fastest way to confirm this metabolic complication of cancer.\n\nProstate cancer frequently metastasises to bone—especially the vertebrae and pelvis—where tumour cells can dysregulate normal bone turnover. Although prostate metastases are often sclerotic, local osteoblastic activity and occasional osteolysis can release calcium into the circulation. Early detection via serum calcium allows prompt management to prevent complications such as dehydration, nephrolithiasis, and cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**  \n- **A. Serum potassium** – Hypokalaemia can cause ileus, but this patient’s combination of depression, polyuria and fluid intake strongly points to hypercalcaemia rather than a primary potassium disturbance.  \n- **C. Urea** – Elevated urea may reflect dehydration or renal impairment but would not explain the constellation of psychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms as directly as hypercalcaemia.  \n- **D. CT scan of the head** – Neuroimaging is not indicated without focal neurological deficits or altered sensorium; this patient’s symptoms are systemic rather than focal.  \n- **E. CRP** – An inflammatory marker is unlikely to change management here, as there is no evidence of infection or inflammatory flare; it would not detect a metabolic derangement.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points:**  \n1. **Hypercalcaemia in malignancy** is often due to osteolytic metastases or tumour secretion of parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP).  \n2. **Classic symptoms**: “Bones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones”—bone pain, kidney stones, abdominal discomfort, constipation, polyuria/polydipsia, nausea, and mental status changes.  \n3. **Investigation**: Always check corrected serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) in cancer patients with nonspecific constitutional or neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology, Diagnostics & Management:**  \n**Pathophysiology:**  \n- Tumour cells either produce PTHrP, which mimics parathyroid hormone to increase bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, or directly activate osteoclasts in bone metastases.  \n- Resulting hypercalcaemia impairs neuronal excitability (leading to lethargy, depression), reduces smooth muscle contractility (causing constipation), and impairs renal concentrating ability (polyuria and polydipsia).\n\n**Diagnostics:**  \n1. **Corrected serum calcium**: Calculate to account for hypo- or hyperalbuminaemia; if abnormal, confirm with ionised calcium measurement.  \n2. **PTH and PTHrP**: Differentiate primary hyperparathyroidism from malignancy-driven hypercalcaemia.  \n3. **25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)₂D**: Rule out vitamin D–mediated causes of hypercalcaemia.  \n4. **Renal function and ECG**: Assess for dehydration and cardiac effects (short QT, arrhythmias).\n\n**Management:**  \n1. **Initial**: Aggressive intravenous hydration with isotonic saline to enhance renal calcium excretion.  \n2. **Bisphosphonates** (e.g., zoledronic acid) or **denosumab**: Inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; onset in 48–72 hours.  \n3. **Calcitonin**: Provides rapid but short-lived reduction in calcium; useful in severe cases.  \n4. **Glucocorticoids**: Beneficial in vitamin D–mediated hypercalcaemia and certain malignancies.  \n5. **Dialysis**: Reserved for life-threatening hypercalcaemia with renal failure or heart failure unresponsive to medical therapy.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nIn cancer patients presenting with nonspecific neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms, always measure serum calcium promptly to diagnose and manage hypercalcaemia of malignancy, thereby preventing serious sequelae."

  ],
  "correct": "E",
  "explanation": "**Correct Answer: E. Dexamethasone**\n\n**Why it’s correct:**  \nCompression of the superior vena cava by a mediastinal tumour impedes venous drainage from the head, neck and upper limbs, causing facial and arm oedema, distended chest and neck veins, and raised intracranial pressure manifesting as headache. High-dose corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily, orally or intravenously) rapidly reduce peritumoural inflammation and capillary permeability, shrinking vasogenic oedema and restoring venous flow. Symptomatic improvement—in reduction of swelling and headache—often occurs within 24–48 hours, making steroids the preferred first-line intervention in SVC syndrome without airway compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**  \n- **A. Furosemide** reduces intravascular volume but does not address the underlying peritumoural swelling and may exacerbate hypotension without relieving venous obstruction.  \n- **B. Diamorphine** provides analgesia but has no effect on oedema or venous congestion, and can worsen sedation in a patient with raised intracranial pressure.  \n- **C. Metoprolol** might slow heart rate but is irrelevant to venous drainage or oedema in SVC syndrome.  \n- **D. Apixaban** is an anticoagulant with no role in relieving tumour-induced vascular compression and carries bleeding risks without benefit.\n\n---\n\n**High-Yield Points & Key Information:**  \n1. **Presentation:** Facial plethora, arm swelling, distended neck/chest wall veins, headache—classic for SVC obstruction.  \n2. **Immediate management:** Start dexamethasone 8 mg BID to reduce oedema; elevate head of bed and provide oxygen as needed.  \n3. **Definitive therapy:** After stabilisation and tissue diagnosis, consider endovascular stenting for rapid decompression or targeted radiotherapy/chemotherapy based on tumour sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n**Pathophysiology, Diagnostics & Management:**  \n- **Pathophysiology:** A mediastinal mass compresses the thin-walled SVC, raising upstream hydrostatic pressure. Fluid extravasates into interstitial tissues (oedema), and collateral veins (azygos and chest wall plexus) enlarge over weeks but cannot acutely compensate. Increased cerebral venous pressure causes headache and can risk cerebral oedema.  \n- **Diagnostics:** Contrast CT chest confirms location, size and degree of SVC narrowing, identifies collateral flow, and excludes thrombus.  \n- **Management Steps:**  \n  1. **Immediate:** High-dose dexamethasone to reduce peritumoural oedema.  \n  2. **Supportive:** Head elevation, supplemental oxygen, cautious diuretics if volume overloaded.  \n  3. **Histology:** Biopsy to guide tumour-specific therapy; steroids may be paused if lymphoma is strongly suspected to preserve diagnostic yield.  \n  4. **Definitive:** Endovascular stent placement for immediate relief when anatomy permits; radiotherapy or chemotherapy for longer-term tumour reduction.\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nIn superior vena cava syndrome without airway obstruction, prompt administration of dexamethasone is essential to relieve peritumoural oedema and venous hypertension, providing rapid symptomatic benefit while definitive interventions are planned."
