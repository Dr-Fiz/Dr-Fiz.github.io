          {label:'D',text:'Squamous metaplasia'},
          {label:'E',text:'Carcinomatous changes'}
        ],
        correct: 'C',
        explanation: `Barrett's oesophagus is a condition in which there is an abnormal (metaplastic) change where columnar epithelium replaces the normal stratified squamous epithelium in the lower portion of the oesophagus. This occurs in the presence of prolonged acid injury seen in patients suffering from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). There is an increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.

Squamous metaplasia is incorrect. Squamous metaplasia is where the lining of the cells undergo benign non-cancerous changes to a squamous morphology. It is quite the opposite in Barrett's oesophagus as stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by columnar epithelium, which is called “columnar metaplasia.”`},

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 110 U/L (10–50)
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 430 U/L (40–120)
Total bilirubin 140 µmol/L (3–17)
Albumin 39 g/L (35–50)
International normalised ratio (INR) 1.1 (0.9–1.2)

          {label:'E',text:'Cholestatic hepatitis'}
        ],
        correct:'E',
        explanation: `The most likely diagnosis is cholestatic hepatitis, given the temporal relationship between the recent use of co-amoxiclav and the onset of jaundice. Co-amoxiclav is a well-recognised cause of drug-induced liver injury, typically presenting with a cholestatic pattern characterised by elevated ALP and bilirubin, with relatively less marked transaminase elevation. The onset of symptoms often occurs a few weeks after drug exposure, consistent with this case.

The patient's low alcohol intake (12 units per week) makes alcoholic hepatitis unlikely, as alcoholic hepatitis is more commonly associated with heavy and sustained alcohol use and presents with a hepatocellular pattern of injury.`},

        text: `An 83-year-old woman who is a resident in a nursing home is admitted to hospital with a 4-day history of diarrhea. She has had no weight loss or change in appetite. She has been on analgesics for 3 weeks to manage her back pain. She is in obvious discomfort. Rectal examination reveals faecal impaction with hard stools. What is the SINGLE most appropriate immediate management?`,

          {label:'E',text:'Urinary catheterisation'}
        ],
        correct:'D',
        explanation: `This is an example of overflow diarrhoea. Medications such as opioid pain relievers reduce intestinal movement and may cause faecal matter to become too large, hard and dry making it difficult to expel. Subsequently, faeces becomes so hard that they cannot be expelled and faecal fluid will flow around the block.

Phosphate enemas contain sodium acid phosphate and sodium phosphate. The osmotic activity of the former increases the water content of the stool so that rectal distension follows and it is thought that this induces defecation by stimulating rectal motility. It has a very quick onset of action which makes enemas useful for when a rapid evacuation of a stony dull faecal impaction is required.`},

          {label:'D',text:'Manometry'},
          {label:'E',text:'Barium swallow'}
        ],
        correct:'A',
        explanation: `We know this is a very controversial question. The top two choices would be endoscopy and barium swallow. It is a complicated question and we had to seek advice from our gastroenterology colleagues to address this question.

The differentials that need to be considered here are diffuse oesophageal spasms, achalasia, scleroderma, oesophageal ring, oesophageal web and oesophageal cancer.

The description in the stem best fits diffuse oesophageal spasm except that there is usually dysphagia to both solids and liquids. The stem only includes dysphagia to solids without mentioning liquids.

As he is young and cancer is unlikely, so understandably many candidates would pick a barium swallow rather than an endoscopy. A barium swallow is less invasive and can be used to diagnose conditions like diffuse oesophageal spasms or achalasia. However, that is an incorrect option. Patients with dysphagia, despite their age, should undergo endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders first. Barium swallow is considered where endoscopy is not possible or if endoscopy is normal but a structural abnormality is still suspected.

Throughout medical school, you have been taught that achalasia and diffuse oesophageal spasms can be seen in barium swallow and the gold standard is manometry. That teaching is now outdated. Endoscopy is a must do first for any patients with dysphagia prior to proceeding to a barium swallow or manometry.

We are aware that there are reliable sources that would state that a barium swallow would be reasonable to perform first, however, we have done intense research on this and together with our gastroenterology colleagues, have decided that an endoscopy would be the most initial. This goes in line with the NICE CKS guidelines as well where patients with dysphagia irrelevant of age should have an endoscopy. This guidance is also taken from the “British Society of Gastroenterology for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring” published in 2019 and the “European guidelines on achalasia: United European Gastroenterology and European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility recommendations” published in 2020.

In summary, this is what we believe you should pick in the exam:
• Dysphagia + Initial investigation → Endoscopy (with exceptions of suspicion of pharyngeal pouch)
• Dysphagia + Diffuse oesophageal spasm/achalasia stem + Most appropriate investigation → Barium swallow or manometry

        ],
        correct:'B',
        explanation: `The correct answer is option B. Ascending cholangitis. This is a classical presentation with Charcot's triad of fever, RUQ pain and jaundice. Abdominal sepsis is one of three most common types of sepsis, particularly as this lady recently had a procedure; the time of presentation is most suspicious of an infective pathology.

Ascending cholangitis following ERCP is relatively rare, but when it does occur, it typically develops within the first few days following the procedure. The exact timeframe can vary, but most cases of post-ERCP cholangitis manifest within 1–7 days after the procedure. In some cases, cholangitis can develop within hours, especially if there is significant contamination of the bile ducts during the procedure.`}
