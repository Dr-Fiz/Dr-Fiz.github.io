      {
    text: "What are the important red flags in child development?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Unable to walk by 12 months' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Time-out works to get a child to begin doing a behavior' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Unable to sit by 9 months' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Unable to hold head by 1 month' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Key developmental milestones include head control by 4 months, sitting by 9 months, crawling by 12 months, and walking by 18 months. Failure to sit by 9 months is a “red flag” for gross motor delay. The other options either describe behavior management (B) or are not true delays at the given ages (A and D).'
  },
  {
    text: "What characterizes the growth and development of a child during the school-age period (6–12 years)?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Growth in height' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Gradual growth' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Growth in weight' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Growth tables' }
    ],
    correct: 'B',
    explanation: 'Between ages 6 and 12, children grow at a steady, gradual pace in both height and weight. This contrasts with the rapid “infancy” and “pubertal” growth spurts. Thus “gradual growth” best describes the pattern in the school‐age years.'
  },
  {
    text: "What is the best method to reduce potassium levels in hyperkalemia by actually removing potassium from the body?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Calcium infusion' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Glucose and insulin infusion' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Sodium bicarbonate infusion' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Kayexalate enema' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Albuterol aerosol' }
    ],
    correct: 'D',
    explanation: 'Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) binds potassium in the gut and increases its fecal excretion. The other therapies (A, B, C, E) shift potassium into cells or stabilize the myocardium but do not remove K⁺ from the body.'
  },
  {
    text: "At what age should an infant regain the weight they had at birth?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: '1 week' },
      { label: 'B', text: '4–5 months' },
      { label: 'C', text: '10 days' },
      { label: 'D', text: '1 month' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Healthy newborns typically lose up to 10% of birth weight in the first week but regain it by 10–14 days of life. Regaining birth weight by around 10 days is the expected norm.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which of the following actions can a typical one-year-old child perform?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Drinks from cup' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Sits down from standing position' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Rings bell purposefully' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Speaks one or two words with meaning' }
    ],
    correct: 'A',
    explanation: 'By 12 months, most children can drink from a cup with some spilling. Purposeful ringing of a bell and meaningful words often emerge closer to 15–18 months, and sitting down from standing usually appears later as balance and coordination improve.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which agent listed does NOT cause an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Aspirin' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Carbon monoxide inhalation' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Paraldehyde' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Iron' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Acetazolamide' }
    ],
    correct: 'E',
    explanation: 'Acetazolamide induces a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis by causing bicarbonate loss (proximal RTA). Aspirin, paraldehyde, iron overdose, and CO poisoning can produce organic acids or impair metabolism, leading to an elevated anion gap.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which of the following drugs is NOT associated with causing hypokalemia?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Corticosteroids' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Gentamicin' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Amiloride' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Loop diuretics' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Theophylline' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Amiloride is a potassium‐sparing diuretic that reduces urinary K⁺ excretion and can cause hyperkalemia. In contrast, corticosteroids, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), loop diuretics, and theophylline promote renal K⁺ loss, leading to hypokalemia.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which childhood disorder tends to improve naturally with increasing age?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Sleep disorder' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Conduct disorder' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Temper tantrum' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Emotional problems' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Temper tantrums are most common in toddlers and typically diminish by preschool age as self‐regulation develops. Conduct disorders and emotional problems often persist without intervention, and sleep disorders have variable courses.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which statement about colic in infants is correct?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Fever often accompanies colic' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Colic is very rarely seen' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'None of the above are correct' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Colic usually occurs in infants greater than 3 months of age' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Infantile colic typically begins at 2–4 weeks of age, peaks around 6 weeks, and resolves by 3–4 months. It is common (up to 20% of infants) and is not accompanied by fever. Therefore, none of the provided statements are correct.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which method for identifying children with developmental or behavioral concerns has the worst sensitivity?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Flagging all children in NICU with risk factors for disability' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Hands-on developmental screening tool (e.g., Denver II)' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Physician clinical impression about development, without a screening tool' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Parent-answered developmental questionnaire' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'All have about equal sensitivity' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: 'Unaided clinical impression by physicians misses many subtle delays: its sensitivity is far lower than standardized tools like the Denver II or validated parent questionnaires. Structured screening greatly improves detection of developmental concerns.'
  },
  {
    text: "Which of the following statements about Kwashiorkor is NOT true?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Rash in sun-exposed areas' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Hypochromotrichia' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'An increased susceptibility to infection' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Weak muscle' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'The presence of edema' }
    ],
    correct: 'B',
    explanation: "Kwashiorkor is a severe protein‐energy malnutrition marked by hypoalbuminemia and resultant peripheral edema, the classic 'flaky‐paint' dermatosis often on pressure or sun‐exposed areas, muscle wasting (manifesting as weakness), fatty liver, and immune compromise leading to increased infections. Hair changes include the 'flag sign'—alternating pigmented and depigmented bands—and brittle, discolored hair rather than uniform loss of pigment. Thus, 'hypochromotrichia' (uniformly pale hair) is not a characteristic feature and is the false statement."
  },
  {
    text: "With regards to hypernatremia, which statement is incorrect?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'It is clinically manifest primarily by neurological effects' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'It should not be corrected faster than 0.5 mmol/L/hr' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Normal saline should not be used if the patient is hypovolemic and hypotensive' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'It is usually associated with inadequate water intake' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'If associated with hypervolemia, then furosemide should be used' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "Hypernatremia presents chiefly with neurological signs—lethargy, irritability, seizures—due to cellular dehydration in the brain. Correction must proceed slowly (<0.5 mmol/L/hr) to avoid cerebral edema. In hypovolemic hypernatremia, isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) is first used to restore circulating volume before switching to hypotonic fluids for free water replacement, so the statement that 'normal saline should not be used' is false. Hypernatremia most often reflects inadequate water intake or loss; and if hypervolemic, loop diuretics such as furosemide can help remove excess sodium and water."
  },
  {
    text: "Which drug listed below is NOT associated with causing hypokalemia?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Theophylline' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Gentamicin' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Amiloride' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Corticosteroids' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Loop diuretics' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "Amiloride is a potassium‐sparing diuretic that blocks ENaC channels in the distal nephron, reducing renal K⁺ excretion and predisposes to hyperkalemia. In contrast, loop diuretics inhibit the NKCC2 transporter in the thick ascending limb and cause significant K⁺ loss; corticosteroids have mineralocorticoid effects that increase renal K⁺ wasting; aminoglycosides like gentamicin can cause renal tubular injury and secondary K⁺ loss; and theophylline increases renal blood flow and tubular secretion of potassium."
  },
  {
    text: "What is the primary reason newborns lose up to 10% of their weight in the first few days after birth?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Infant hormones' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'All of the above' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Loss of extracellular fluids' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Breastfeeding' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "Physiologic weight loss in the first 3–5 days (up to ~10% of birth weight) is almost entirely due to diuresis of excess extracellular fluid and insensible water loss as the neonate transitions from intrauterine to extrauterine life. Hormonal adaptations and initial feeding patterns play minor roles, and delayed catabolism of fetal fluid stores—not inadequate intake—explains the early decline."
  },
  {
    text: "Hyperkalemia may be associated with all of the following conditions EXCEPT?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Succinylcholine use' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Uremia' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Trauma' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Digitalis toxicity' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Chemotherapy' },
      { label: 'F', text: 'Metabolic alkalosis' },
      { label: 'G', text: 'Burns' }
    ],
    correct: 'F',
    explanation: "Hyperkalemia arises from cellular release of K⁺ (as in trauma, burns, chemotherapy–induced tumor lysis, succinylcholine-mediated membrane depolarization) or impaired renal excretion (uremia, digitalis-induced Na⁺/K⁺‐ATPase inhibition). In contrast, metabolic alkalosis shifts K⁺ into cells in exchange for H⁺, leading to hypokalemia rather than hyperkalemia—making ‘metabolic alkalosis’ the exception."
  },
  {
    text: "A 1-month-old baby with severe failure to thrive, vomiting (emesis), fever of 41 °C, very high sodium (185 mEq/L), and low urine specific gravity (1.001). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Hypernatremic dehydration' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Salt poisoning' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Malignant hyperthermia' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Adrenal insufficiency' }
    ],
    correct: 'B',
    explanation: "This infant’s presentation—high fever, vomiting, marked hypernatremia, dilute urine (low specific gravity), and failure to thrive—points to hypernatremic dehydration from free-water loss exceeding sodium loss. Nephrogenic DI would show persistent polyuria despite volume contraction; salt poisoning (acute hypernatremia) typically has very concentrated urine; malignant hyperthermia and adrenal insufficiency do not explain the lab pattern."
  },
  {
    text: "Which is a true statement about using time-outs as a behavioral strategy for children?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'A good rule of thumb is to use five minutes of time-out per year of age' },
      { label: 'B', text: "A terrific place to have a time-out is the child's room" },
      { label: 'C', text: 'This method should be considered with certain types of behaviors including impulsive, aggressive, hostile actions' },
      { label: 'D', text: "A good time-out is when the parent praises the child outside of the child's playgroup" }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "Time-outs are most effective when used selectively for targeted behaviors—especially impulsive or aggressive acts—allowing the child to calm down and reflect. The recommended duration is roughly one minute per year of age (not five), they should occur in a neutral setting (not the child's bedroom, which can feel punitive), and positive reinforcement—not praise outside the playgroup—should follow appropriate behaviors, not the time-out itself."
  },
  {
    text: "Which is an acceptable approach to managing infant colic?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Let the baby cry and ignore the baby' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Try to discover why your infant is crying' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Shake the baby to sleep' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Put the baby in a car seat on the washing machine' }
    ],
    correct: 'D',
    explanation: "While the exact cause of colic is unknown and no single therapy works for all, gentle vestibular stimulation—such as placing the safely buckled infant in a car seat on a running washing machine—can soothe by providing rhythmic motion. Ignoring the infant or shaking to sleep is unsafe, and prolonged attempts to identify a single cause can increase parental stress without relieving symptoms."
  },
  {
    text: "An infant can briefly sit leaning forward, reaches for and grasps a cube, and transfers it between hands, but cannot wave bye-bye and cannot use a finger-thumb (pincer) grasp. What is her most likely age?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: '14 months' },
      { label: 'B', text: '4 months' },
      { label: 'C', text: '7 months' },
      { label: 'D', text: '10 months' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "By around 7 months, most infants can prop-sit (briefly support themselves by leaning on hands), reach deliberately for objects, grasp a cube with a raking grasp, and transfer objects hand-to-hand. Waving goodbye emerges closer to 9 months, and the mature pincer grasp (thumb-finger opposition) appears around 9–10 months; by 14 months, these fine motor skills are well established."
  },
  {
    text: "Which of the following does NOT cause a metabolic alkalosis?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Thiazide diuretics' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Vomiting' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Loop diuretics' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Corticosteroids' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Diarrhea' }
    ],
    correct: 'E',
    explanation: "Metabolic alkalosis results from net acid loss or bicarbonate retention—seen with thiazide and loop diuretics (contraction alkalosis), vomiting (gastric HCl loss), and corticosteroids (enhanced H⁺ secretion). Diarrhea causes bicarbonate loss in stool, leading instead to a normal-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, so it does not produce alkalosis."
  },
  {
    text: "At what age (out of the options provided) is it best for a physician to administer a developmental screening tool?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'In utero' },
      { label: 'B', text: '7 years' },
      { label: 'C', text: '2 years' },
      { label: 'D', text: '10 years' }
    ],
    correct: 'C',
    explanation: "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends formal developmental screening at key intervals—most importantly at 9, 18, and 24 months—to detect delays in motor, language, social, and cognitive domains when early intervention is most effective. Of the ages listed, 2 years (24 months) falls squarely within this window. Screening 'in utero' is not possible, and waiting until 7 or 10 years misses critical opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention."
  },
  {
    text: "A 6-month-old has a long tonic-clonic seizure, is hypothermic and lethargic. The mother diluted the baby’s formula with water to make it last longer. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Hypocalcemia' },
      { label: 'B', text: 'Hyponatremia' },
      { label: 'C', text: 'Hypokalemia' },
      { label: 'D', text: 'Hypernatremia' },
      { label: 'E', text: 'Hypoglycemia' }
    ],
    correct: 'B',
    explanation: "Diluting formula introduces excess free water relative to solute, causing hypotonic hyponatremia. The resulting low plasma osmolality drives water into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema, seizures, lethargy, and even hypothermia. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures but would not produce a low urine specific gravity; hypernatremia dehydration would present with concentrated urine and hyperosmolar symptoms rather than low specific gravity."

    text: "How is infant colic classified?",
    options: [
      { label: 'A', text: 'Crying constantly' },

They generally regain that birth weight by 10–14 days of age. Regaining weight by around 10 days is the expected norm, whereas 1 week is often too soon and 1 month or later suggests inadequate intake or pathology."

A hair tourniquet (a stray hair wrapped tightly around a toe, finger, or genitalia) can cause ischemia and intense pain. Corneal abrasions lead to eye pain, photophobia, and refusal to open the eye. Fractures—whether accidental or nonaccidental—cause pain on movement, swelling, or crepitus.

It typically begins between 2–4 weeks of age, peaks around 6 weeks, and resolves by 3–4 months.

Low serum sodium reduces plasma osmolality, causing water to shift into brain cells, resulting in cerebral edema, seizures, lethargy, and even hypothermia. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures but would not explain a low serum sodium; hypernatremia causes dehydration and concentrated urine; hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular irritability but typically presents earlier; hypokalemia seldom provokes seizures."

Effective parenting relies on consistent discipline strategies—modeling, positive reinforcement, and natural consequences—rather than equating discipline with punitive measures. The other statements are true: children generally seek parental approval, self-control develops gradually over years, and observational learning through parental modeling is fundamental."

By this time, infants demonstrate good head control, the extrusion reflex diminishes, and gastrointestinal and renal systems are mature enough to handle solids. Introducing solids too early (2–4 months) risks choking and allergies; waiting until 8–9 months may lead to iron deficiency, as fetal iron stores become depleted by around 6 months."

Absent femoral pulses suggest obstructive or cardiogenic shock, not septic shock."

The recommended bolus is 3% NaCl at 2–5 mL/kg (≈10 mL for a 5 kg infant) given over 10–20 minutes, raising serum sodium by 3–5 mmol/L and aborting seizures. A slow infusion at 5 mL/h is too gradual; isotonic saline bolus may further dilute sodium; lorazepam treats the seizure but not the underlying hyponatremia; mannitol is for raised intracranial pressure of another etiology, not hyponatremic seizure."

In hypervolemic hypernatremia, loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) remove excess Na⁺ and water.

CO₂ is acidic, and a high level contributes to a lower pH.\n3. **HCO₃⁻ = 23 mEq/L**: This is within the normal range (22–26 mEq/L), showing that there has been no metabolic compensation yet.\n\nSince the pH is low (acidemia), and the PaCO₂ is high (retained CO₂ due to hypoventilation or lung dysfunction), this points to respiratory acidosis. The fact that the bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) level is normal means the kidneys haven't compensated yet, suggesting an acute (uncompensated) respiratory acidosis."
